========

This is a quick personal project

Part One will pull the Top PlayStation 3 Games from MediaCritic and output them as a simple JSON using pull_scores.php

Part Two will expose a simple Rest API to allow for retrieval of the full game list 
  or return the score for a title passed into the API
